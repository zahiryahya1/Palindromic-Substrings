# Palindromic-Substrings

## Question:

Given a string, your task is to count how many palindromic substrings in this string. The substrings with different start indexes or end indexes are counted as different substrings even they consist of same characters.

## Solution:

First we need to create all substrings of size 1 to n.
Next, for each substring, we need to check if its a palindrom.
